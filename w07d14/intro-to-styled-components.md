# React Styling

## Learning Objectives

- Compare and contrast the four ways that styling is done in React
- Use objects to add dynamic inline styles
- Identify the ES6 tagged template literal syntax
- Use styled components and polished to create a simple component

## Framing

As with all things `coding` there are many ways to accomplish the same thing. Take for instance the need to run simple conditional logic.  Depending on the use case any of the follow might suffice: 

- if/else
- switch statement
- ternary operators

What about looping and/or filtering an array of data. Once again depending on the use case several approaches could be taken: 

- for loop
- Array.forEach()
- Array.filter()
- Array.reduce()

Styling is no different React and depending on your need and/or level of experience several approaches can be taken:

- a single all encompassing CSS file for the entire app
- individual CSS files for each Component
- upgrading your CSS to use Sass/SCSS 
- inline styles and/or JS conditional logic to update values 
- import a library such as Styled Components

Before we go on let's take a moment to answer the following question:

:question: How would you define a Component and it's place in React and the React Ecosystem? 

<hr>

## Components As Self-Contained

Based on the answers provided to the previous question it's clear that the first concept we need to keep in mind is that `Components` are meant to be **self-contained** and **reusable**.

<hr>

#### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="alarm_clock" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/23f0.png">⏰</g-emoji> Activity - 2min

Components, React or otherwise,  are now becoming the standard for sharing small pieces of functionality.  

Let's take a look at  [https://bit.dev/](https://bit.dev/) which is an environment developers can share their own custom and reusable [React Components](https://bit.dev/components?q=react). 

There is also another powerful site called [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/) that enables developers to create and share Components. 

<hr>

Since Components should be built as self contained and reusable entities it makes sense they would be constructed with the internal logic to control their behavior. 

When our CSS **behaviors** are an integrated as part of our code, we can use `props` and `state` to thoroughly control the view, including styling, versus swapping out classes.

Fortunately, lots of techniques, frameworks, tooling and other open source projects have been built an popularized to fill the gaps. Three popular ways that you'll likely encounter are:

- CSS Stylesheets
- Inline Styles
- CSS-in-JS (CSS Modules & Styled Components)

## Starter Code

Here is the [Starter Code](https://codesandbox.io/s/styles-4-ways-starter-13qy5?file=/src/App.js) we will be using for this lecture. 

## CSS Stylesheet

The first and most basic approach is importing CSS files directly into our components.

```js
import './styles.css';
```

We can import a single `css` file at the highest level in the app or create separate `css` files that target a specific Component. A great way to organize your app would be to place `Components` into separate folders along with the `css` file.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8WUzfcr.png" />

#### Benefits

- Anyone working in front end design knows how to use them
- Smaller subset of css files making it easy to find and edit
- Full access to all CSS specifications (animations, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, etc.)

#### Drawbacks

- CSS may be overridden by more specific rules

## Inline Styling

The term `separation of concerns` is a design principle in CS that refers to separating functionality into distinct sections to make it modular. Under `SoC`, it's logical that we separate our CSS, HTML and JS into independent files which has been the standard in the web dev community since it's birth. 

As a result, [inline styles were considered bad practice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2612483/whats-so-bad-about-in-line-css).

Inline styles, particularly in the context of components, does make a lot of sense though and is aligns with the idea that `what goes together should stay together`.

### Style Object

When using `inline-styles` we might opt to assign the style directly in the JSX which works best for a single style.

```html
<div style={{color: primary}}></div>
```

Or create a `styles` object that includes several styles and then assign the object.

```js
export default function InlineStyle() {
  const buttonStyles = {
    backgroundColor: primary,
    color: '#fff',
    padding: '7px 14px',
    margin: '0 5px',
    borderRadius: '5px',
    border: '1px solid transparent',
  };

  return (
  <div style={{ color: 'red' }}>
    <h2>Inline Styles</h2>
    <button>Primary</button>
  </div>
  );
}
```
#### Conditional Logic
We can also used conditional logic to determine which values should be assigned to specific css rules.  

```js
const buttonStyles = {
  backgroundColor: props.primary ?  primary : danger ,
  // ...rest of styles
};
```

This works well enough for the most basic logic of a single button.  But when multiple buttons are introduced that require different background colors and/or  effects such as `hover`, then the code can get messy very quickly. 

#### Benefits of Styled Objects

- No special tools needed and takes advantage of existing coding knowledge
- Leverage  `props` and `state` to make dynamic updates
- Component level styles stay with the component


#### Drawbacks of Styled Objects

- Limited support of CSS specification (no animations, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, etc.)
- Hard to read and difficult to override (must use !important flag)
- Hard to document and maintain

## CSS in JS

CSS in JS lets you you style your presentation with JavaScript instead of CSS. Then, when your application is run, the JavaScript is parsed and generates CSS, which is attached to your DOM directly.

### CSS Modules

One major issues of standard CSS or Sass/SCSS is that there is no concept of true encapsulation and requires that the developer to choose unique class names. 

And this is exactly what `CSS modules` do, it relies on creating dynamic class names for each locally defined style and making sure styles didn't conflict. 

It's creators designed it to be lightweight and not try to be everything to everyone. It does however only support a handful of features.

<hr>

#### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="alarm_clock" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/23f0.png">⏰</g-emoji> Activity - 2min

Let's take a look at a site like [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) which  uses CSS Modules.  

We will focus our attention specifically on the `header` element of their home page and the class names. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/W19mc86.png" width=500/>

<hr>

The basic premise is that the css classes are converted using a preprocessor into unique names in order to create `local scoping`. 

While additional tooling is needed to handle the processing of the files, `create-react-app`, which `CodeSandox` uses, includes this tooling by default.

The actual css file must include `.module` in it's name.  So if you are using standard css then the name might be `styles.module.css` but your using SCSS then it would be `sytles.module.scss`.  The rule written will then be dependent on which one you are using. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FWdD5YU.png" />


#### Importing styles

The file is then imported, but this time we store the import in a variable as it returns an object.  

Let's also add a console log and see what that import looks like.
```js
import styles from './styles.module.css';
console.log('styles', styles);
```

From the console log it's clear that the css rules are assigned as keys and the values are `module` specific.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/q2tirlw.png" />

The rules are then applied to the elements using dot notation.

```html
<div className={styles.container}>
  <h2>Modules</h2>
  <button className={styles.primary}>Primary</button>
  <button className={styles.secondary}>Secondary</button>
  <button className={styles.success}>Success</button>
</div>
```

If we take a look at the `button` element in the `Elements` Tab in DevTools we will see the following:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kDWUghQ.png" />

Since this isn't a standard CSS name there is no way these styles will conflict with another element in the global scope that has been assigned a class of `.button` as well. 

#### Benefits of CSS Modules

- Component level styles stay with the component
- Import/Export common styles between files
- Access to full CSS specification including support of [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) for variable support

#### Drawbacks of CSS Modules

- Limited access to `props` and `state`
- No Sass/SCSS like features except `composes`


## Styled Components 

One of the most popular and advanced CSS-in-JS libraries is [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

Now that were jumping into styled components let's take a look at a [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) and see styled components in action.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OfpsvWR.png" width=500/>

**Install Styled Components**

Since `styled components` in a third party library it must first be installed as an NPM package.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zCX1cFF.png" />

<br>
<br>

**Import The Library**

Which then must be imported.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';
```

Styled Components do a great job of taking advantage of an ES6 feature called a `Tagged Template Literal`, or perhaps you know it as `String Template Literal`.

**Using Styled Components**

Let's create two styled components, one for the `container` and the other for the  `button`. 

```js
const Container = styled.div`

`;

const Button = styled.button`

`;
```

**Adding Styles**

Let's add some styles to the `Container`.  Adding a `color` can be done by either written literally by it's name/hex/rgb or by referencing a variable. 

```js
const Container = styled.div`
  color: red;
  // or
  color: ${warning}
`
```
Now the `Button`.  Since we are also adding a `hover` effect , which is a `pseudoclass` we must include `&:hover`.

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: ${primary}
  color: #fff;
  padding: 7px 14px;
  margin:0 5px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  border: 1px solid transparent;

  &:hover {
    background-color: red;
  }
`
```

If we take a look at those elements in the `Elements` Tab of DevTools we will see that the class names begin with `sc-` and then end with a mix of difference characters.  

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BDJ3rOR.png" />

### Conditional Logic
Just as we did with inline styles we can use conditional logic to determine which css values are assigned to a style.  

Conditional logic can be added in the following ways:

- a single ternary operator
- a callback function based on `prop` passed to the styled component

#### Ternary Operator
Let's try and set the color based on passing in a `primary` prop. This requires that the parent element pass down the props to this component. 

Being that were using `string template literals` when creating the component we must include `${}` when referencing variables. 

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: ${props.primary ?  primary : secondary };
  // ...rest of css
`
```

Here is what the rendered Components look like in React DevTools

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZuqZizF.png" width=700/>

### Passing Styled Components Their Own Props

As we render the `styled component` we can pass it unique props of it's own just as we would do with any Component. 


```js
<ButtonTwo primary>Customized</ButtonTwo>
```

<hr>

#### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="alarm_clock" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/23f0.png">⏰</g-emoji> Activity - 2min


:question: Since we only passed a prop name but no value use DevTools to explore if it's been assigned a value and what that value might be. 

<hr>

So it appears it doesn't actually need to be assigned a value and will assign a value of `true` just because the prop exists. 

Now within the `styled component` we can't just reference that props like before but need to pass that value via an `anonymous function` and run additional JS conditional logic. 

```js
border-radius: ${props => {
    console.log('props', props)
    if (props.primary) return '20px'
    return '0'
}};
```

Here is what the console log looks like

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JvgqV1F.png" />

We do have the option to also pass the prop a value as well. 

```js
<ButtonTwo primary={'blue'}>Customized</ButtonTwo>
```
And then we can either use it directly as assigned or run conditional logic. 

```js
border-radius: ${props => {
    console.log('props', props)
    if (props.primary == 'blue') return '20px'
    return '0'
}};
```

#### Helpers

Styled components come with several [Helper functions](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#helpers) such as:

- css
- keyframes
- many more

**CSS** 

Let's take a look at `css` and use it to create and share css between multiple components. 


The functions need to be imported.  

```js
import styled, {css} from 'styled-components';
```

Then we create our shared styles.

```js
const sharedStyles = css`
  color: ${props => (props.standard ? white : warning)};
`
```

And include this in the styled components that need it. 

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  ${props =>  sharedStyles}
  //...rest of css
`
```

**KeyFrames**


The functions need to be imported.  

```js
import styled, {css, keyframes} from 'styled-components';
```

Then create a new keyframe and add the desired animation and timing.

```
const fadeIn = keyframes`
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
`
```

Incorporate the keyframe into the styled component. 

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  ${props =>  sharedStyles}
  animation: 1s ${fadeIn} ease-out;
  //...rest of css
`
```

**Conditional Rendering**

We can also conditionally render the animation on a per component basis based the props passed to it directly.  This involves a combination of `css` and `keyframes`. 

First let's assign a new prop value to the Primary button in order to indicate that this is the only button that should animate.

```html
<Button primary standard animate>Primary</Button>v
```

Let's refactor the current animation value into a fat arrow and run the conditional logic there:

```js
animation: ${(props) =>
  props.animate ? css`${fadeIn} 1s ease-out;`: ''
};
```

This should do the trick but we can also opt to place the css code into it's own external function. 

```js
 const animate = (props) => props.animate ? css` ${fadeIn} 1s ease-out;`: '';
```

And then reference that animation.

```js
animation: ${animate};
```


#### Benefits of Styled Components
- Full access to `props` and `state`
- Component level styles stay with the component
- Access to full CSS specification including support of [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) for variable support
- Sass-like features (such as nesting) and much more if you add [Polished](https://polished.js.org/)

#### Drawbacks of Styled Components

- dependency required
- learning curve (much to learn)

### Bonus -  Sass/SCSS

Both Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) and SCSS (Sassy CSS) are extensions to CSS and provide a robust set of functionality.
