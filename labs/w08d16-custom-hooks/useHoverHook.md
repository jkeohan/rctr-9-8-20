# useHover Custom Hook

## Working Version
Here is a [working version](https://8pkrz.csb.app/) of the app so you have a reference of the base functionality that you are being asked to implement. 


## Starter CodeSandbox
Here is our [Starter CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/styles-4-ways-starter-10-22-20-gpf9t?file=/src/InlineStylesWithHooks/index.js)

This CodeSandbox was used to demo adding styles to React Components and includes several examples, one of which is `Inline Styles`.  

One of the issues we encountered with `Inline Styles` is that adding a hover effect takes much more code than assigning a css `className` or using `Styled Components`.  Take a look at the Component to see for yourself. 

## Instructions
For this exercise you will do the following:



### useHover Hook
Examine this existing solution of the [useHover](https://usehooks.com/page/3) custom Hook and apply it to the `InlineStylesWithHooks` Component. 

- examine the hook solution and get an idea of how it works
- create a file called `useHoverHook.js` that includes the code for this hook
- export the hook

### InlineStylesWithHooks Component
- import and use the hook according to how you see it should be configured

### Bonus 

Try adding more buttons and applying `useHover` to them as well.
