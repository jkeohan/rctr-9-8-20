## Starter CodeSandbox
Here is our [Starter CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/random-user-starter-xtpup?file=/src/App.js)

## Instructions
For this exercise you will do the following:

### App Component
- Examine the working live solution and look over the Components in React DevTools
- import `createContext` 
- create and export an instance of `createContext`
- set up a `context.Provider`
- provide the data via the `context.Provider`

#### Child Components That Need Context
- import the `useContext`
- import the `context` from App
- instantiate `useContext` to use the imported `context` from App
- configure the elements to use the theme


#### Click Event

- Add a click event to the `Toggle Themes` button that will allow the user to toggle between the themes
